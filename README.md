# FL-Client
The Federated Learning Client is an essential component of the federated learning system that runs on individual devices or nodes. This client facilitates the training of machine learning models locally using locally available data while preserving data privacy. The model updates from all participating clients are sent to the Federated Learning Server for aggregation and model improvement.
